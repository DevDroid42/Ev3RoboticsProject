Due to unclear instructions on how to build the robot as well as missing pieces in our kit we ended up with a similar,
yet moderately different robot to what was intended to be built. As such the robot did not write properly with the
provided code. To get the code working both the effective wheel separation, and the degrees per robot degree had to
be changed. We accomplished this by running calibration shapes and tuning the variables until the shapes were drawn
as expected.
